# Something I have done on this assignment:

I have copied App.tsx and IssueList.tsx in my local environment to classroom assignment 4. I checked with chatgpt that typescript(.tsx) has slightly difference with javascript(.js). Template code generated by Android Studio on my laptop is implemented by typescript. You can check my assignment first in JS. If not, you can change the doc into .tsx. If still not work, please let me know and I can record or show offline to you.

The second thing is that I integrated mongoDB and server code in docker-compose. These two middlewares will launch in two separate containers. If you want to launch the server of mine, please use the following commands:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

In addition, for accessing the graphQL server, I set the ip of my laptop rather than localhost or 127.0.0.1. Please be careful of this.
